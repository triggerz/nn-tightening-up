# Description

For a longer period of time, your operators have been taking lengthier and more frequent breaks. Some of your team members think they are entitled to a 20-minute coffee break and 50-minute  lunch break - since they are busy for the rest of the shift. The site management has decided to tighten the rules for breaks, which you also secretly agree is overdue. Tightening the rules means returning to a strict 10 minutes for morning coffee, 30 minutes for lunch and 10 minutes again for afternoon coffee. Your team has actually been managing to meet all their deadlines - even with the longer breaks. You are concerned how your team members will react. What do you do?

# Choice
You don't respond to the management's announcement. Your team members (employees) will be informed about the changes through their union and in the monthly newsletter from the factory management.

# Variables
- Understand how to balance competing interests to do "the right thing" and deal with dilemmas: 0,2
Promotes, fosters and applies the Novo Nordisk Way in all business activities and decision making: 0,2 

# Feedback
You probably chose this option because you don't want to upset your team with the news, anticipating their negative reaction. They can work it out themselves. However, if you do not pass on the site management's announcement, your team may get the impression that you do not fully support the decision.

# Outcome
x

# Choice
You deliver the message to your team members, referring to the fact that the decision has been made at an executive level and add: "and we will obey that decision."

# Variables
Understand how to balance competing interests to do "the right thing" and deal with dilemmas: 0,6
Promotes, fosters and applies the Novo Nordisk Way in all business activities and decision making: 0,5

# Feedback
You chose to inform your team members, which shows you are behind the management's decision, without going into further detail. This shows a good balance of promoting and applying decisions, without demotivating your team members by rubbing in the fact that they might have created the problem.   

# Outcome
x

# Choice
You inform your team members adding that you agree with the decision - the breaks have been too long for some time. You add, "We are responsible for delivering our targets, to ensure our customers get their orders in time." 

# Variables
Acts as a role model of strong leadership: 0,7
Understand how to balance competing interests to do "the right thing" and deal with dilemmas: 0,3
Promotes, fosters and applies the Novo Nordisk Way in all business activities and decision making: 0,7

# Feedback
You chose to add your own observations concerning the team's lengthy breaks. However, no one will thank you for rubbing in the fact that your team members have been ignoring the existing rules. You need to consider when to explain and when to just inform.  

# Outcome
x

# Choice
Although you agree with the decision, you really don't want any trouble at the moment, so you pass on the news about the break rules and add that you acknowledge that the decision is inconvenient - and that you may not interely agree with it. You also say that you in principle don't care much about the rules as long as the team reaches the deadlines.

# Variables

# Feedback
Maybe you chose this option because you fear the reaction of your team members and you want to soften the blow. However, covering up for their longer breaks is not a good option. You need to support and apply the decision made by the management.
